## **Getting Started**

To get started, ensure your development environment is configured as per the [React Native Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) guide. Complete the setup up to the **"Creating a New Application"** step before proceeding.

### **Step 1: Start Metro Server**
Metro is the JavaScript bundler for React Native projects. Start it using the following command from the projectâ€™s root directory:

```bash
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```


If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

### **Step 2: Launch the Application**
With Metro Bundler running in one terminal, open another terminal and run the following commands to start the app on your target platform:

```bash
   # Using npm
   npm run android

   # OR using Yarn
   yarn android

```
